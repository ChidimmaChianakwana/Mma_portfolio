# Airplane Crashes and Fatalities
I used Power query to clean the data and visualised it with powerbi
I analysed the airplane crashes and fatalities from 1908 to 2009. This dataset enables you to deduce:
1. The fatalities by route and location using the map
2. The total number of both ground and air fatalities.
3. The month and year with the most air and ground fatalities.
4. The route that had the most fatalities
5. The aircraft that had the most fatalities by month and year.

From these visuals, I was able to deduce the number of fatalities that was reorded in the 9-11 attack in the united States and so many other major accidents. There are slides available to use to filter the visuals the way you want.
Below is a screenshot of the visual:
